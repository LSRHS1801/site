     <p> Citizenship is, acording to Dictionary.com, "The character of an individual viewed as a member of society; behavior in terms of the duties, obligations, and functions of a citizen". It is made up of many important components, including honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility and courage.</p>
    <h3>Honesty...</h3>
     <p> is very important in order for someone to fulfill their duties as a citizen, and be a good citizen.</p>
    <h3>Compassion...</h3>
      <p> People who have compassion for their community are citizens, they care about their fellow neighbors.</p>
    <h3>Respect...</h3>
      <p> is critical in order to keep a warm and welcoming environment, an important part of a community.</p>
    <h3>Responsibility...</h3>
      <p> is what makes the world turn, and in order to be a citizen you must be a responsible member of society.</p>
    <h3>Courage...</h3>
      <p>is always important, because standing up for what you beleive in makes you who you are and defines your community.</p>
    <h3>Another critical component...</h3>
      <p> of being a good citizen is a sense of community, without this bonding you together there is no community and thus no citizens. </p>
