  <h1> Image Formats </h1>

  <h3>PNG:</h3>
  <p>Used mostly for web images, the PNG file was designed to display lots of colors. It is less compressed than JPEG images so it is almost never used for print images, but it shows lines and text in an image better due to it being less compressed.</p>

  <h3>JPEG:</h3>
  <p>JPEG images are compressed to store lots of information in a small file. They are most often used in digital cameras because of this, small files allow the camera to hold more pictures. However due to its compression some detail is lost, line drawings or text sometimes look a bit grainy and jagged around the edges.</p>

  <h3>GIF:</h3>
  <p>Mostly used for showing animation because it can hold multiple images in a file, GIFs are another form of compressed image similar to JPEGs. GIfs are compressed differently to avaid loss of clarity, so they show line drawings and text better than JPEGs, but are also larger files.
